# Autonomous_tool_for_agricultural_in-row_cultivation
Project developed in a team of four at TU Berlin, in collaboration with the Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy (ATB), Potsdam, Germany. 

The objective of this project was to develop, construct, and test an autonomous mechatronic system implemented on a rover, aimed at eradicating in-row weeds while preserving crops. The goal was to eliminate 80% of the weeds, maintaining a rover speed of 1 km/h.
The designed system comprises multiple components coordinating a rotating rake. An ultrasonic sensor measures the state, identified as the distance between the rake's rotation center and the soil, while an Arduino system controls the actuation through a DC motor.
